                <b>UI Layout -</b>
            </li>
        The game consists of a grid of buttons arranged in a 3x3 layout.
        Each button represents a light that can be toggled on (selected color) or off (default color).\n\n
        <br/>

        <li><b>Color Selection -</b></li>
Before starting the game, users can navigate to the Color Settings Fragment to choose their preferred color for the "on" state.
This selection changes the appearance of the buttons when the game is active.\n\n
            <li><b>Start Game Button -</b></li>
A Start Game button is provided to initialize the game.
Pressing this button sets up the game board, resets all button states, and retrieves the selected color to be used for the "on" state of the buttons.\n\n

            <li><b>Button States -</b></li>
Each button can be in one of two states:
On State: Displayed in the user-selected color (e.g., green).
Off State: Displayed in a default color (e.g., primary color).
The state of each button reflects the current state of the game.\n\n
            <li><b>Game Interaction -</b></li>

Users interact with the game by tapping the buttons:
Tapping a button toggles its state between on and off, potentially changing its color according to the game logic.
The app updates the visual representation of the buttons immediately after a tap to reflect the current game state.\n\n

            <li><b>Game Completion -</b></li>
The game UI monitors the state of the buttons to determine if the game is finished (all buttons are off).
If completed, the UI may provide feedback to the player (e.g., a victory message or option to restart).\n\n
            <li><b>Resetting the Game -</b></li>
If users want to restart the game, they can press the Start Game button again.
The UI resets all buttons to their off state, and the selected color is reapplied for the "on" state.\n
        </ul>
